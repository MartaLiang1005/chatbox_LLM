Good morning.

In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the 
following today:

GE parent guaranty
LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
Opinion of counsel

And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.

Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co Gen 
contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.

Jeff,

Per your request, I am writing a brief note to follow up on our
telephone conversation today.  As we discussed, Enron plans to change
the structure of Enron Telecommunications, Inc. from a regular C
corporation to an LLC.  As we discussed previously, this change in
structure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities
Commission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of
the Public Utilities Code.  You indicated that someone inside Enron was
concerned that, during the course of the CPUC=01,s review of the request
for transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax
returns of ETI=01,s parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would
find unattractive.  You asked me to discuss whether this was possible.

At a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over
entities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC.  Depending on
the facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this
jurisdiction.  However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look
into the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant
telecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking
to acquire control of the carrier.  For nondominant telecommunications
carriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch,
because such carriers have no market power.  You should also be aware
that there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's
financial information from public disclosure.

Thus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review
the books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in
connection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely.  ETI is a
nondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of
ETI, because EBS will still be ETI=01,s owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC,
rather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management
personnel of ETI.

The one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the
Commission because of Enron's presence in the energy market.  While this
logically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably
trigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control.

Please let me know if you need more information or want to discuss
further.

Cindy:  As you recall, Steve Kean, Gwen Petteway, you and I met in Houston on 
May 15th to discuss my job at Enron.  It was my understanding that I would 
receive some response from the company within a week or so after our 
meeting.  Gwen has updated me as to the reasons for the response delay due to 
key executives being on vacation, but regardless I was led to believe I would 
have heard some response around May 24th.  I am getting concerned and would 
like to know the company's position.

In addition, the Performance Review Process has begun for my group and is to 
conclude by June 14th.  I have spoken to Gwen as to my concerns as to whether 
I should participate in this review process.  Although I did not select them 
to review me, both Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro have informed by boss, Joe 
Hillings, or their intentions to review me.  Given the concerns raised by me 
about them during our meeting and concerns expressed to others about them on 
previous occasions,  I have grave reservations as to their ability to provide 
an objective review of my performance.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you further.  My number is

Hi Cynthia.  Can you give me idea as to when the House and Senate mark-ups of 
the electricity bill take place?  I am trying to determine the timeframe in 
which you want to respond to Steve.

Subject: Career Advancement

Dear Cindy:

 It occurred to me that I should share some addition thoughts and concerns 
with you regarding my situation.

 First and foremost, as I tried to make clear during our recent meeting with 
Steve Kean, it is my desire to stay with the company.  I have invested over 
10 years with Enron and feel that I have made substantial contributions to 
its success.  However, I continue to be frustrated over the fact that I have 
been demoted and that  there has been no response to or acknowledgement of my 
application for Joe Hillings' position.  If I am, in fact , not going to be 
considered for the position, I believe I am owed the courtesy of knowing that.

 I would also argue that I have made significant progress in addressing the 
""communication issues"" that have of recent concern to Steve.  I have had a 
number of productive sessions with Jocelyne Gessner, Ph.D. of Personnel 
Decisions International on successful executive relations and management, and 
she informs me that, in her view, my ""deficiencies"" as perceived by Steve in 
that area may have been overstated.  Dr. Gessner has made numerous attempts 
to call Steve to discuss my progress in a tripartite conversation and he has 
not been responsive.  While I recognize that Steve is extremely busy, it 
seems to me that if he, as he stated during our meeting, really wants me to 
stay with the company, he would make it a point to determine if the issues of 
his concern were being addressed.  If he is not interested in garnering 
feedback about my sessions, one could reasonably conclude that the perceived 
""communications problem"" is merely a pretext.

 It also continues to concern me that the restructuring of the Washington 
office has been done without any written changes to my job description.  Many 
people within Enron with whom I have had a long-standing relationship 
continue to ask me for lobbying assistance on various issues because they 
have been satisfied with the results that I have obtained for them in the 
past.  Because some of those issues are now not my primary or secondary area 
of responsibility,  per the new organizational chart, I have been compelled 
to refer those inquiries and requests to others.  In doing so, I fear that 
this could create a misperception that I am unwilling to provide customer 
service to others in the company.  I am sure that you would agree this could, 
in the long run, hurt my chances for increased compensation and advancement.

 The present legislative activity on a number of high-profile Enron 
legislative issues, including the company's top priority of electricity 
restructuring, has precluded me from formally responding to Steve's 
separation offer.  While I recognize that it was made in good faith and that 
it provides a basis for further discussions, I would like to respond after 
the House and Senate mark-ups of the electricity bill take place.

 In the meantime, I would welcome any guidance or suggestions that you might 
have, and I greatly appreciate your interest in my situation.

     Cynthia

Cynthia, 

Steve and I met earlier today.  Call me next week when you get the 
opportunity.  Talk to you soon.
",kean-s,,,"Michelle, please note that among several files that I have had delivered to 
you upon my departure from Enron, please refer to the file on Cynthia 
Sandherr.  It contains documentation from conversations and specific 
situations that ocurred during my 3+ years as HR Rep for Govt Affairs.  As 
the data is very sensitive and confidential, please let Constance if you have 
not received it.

I have now cleared all my emails and have no more hard copies to pass along.  
Feel free to call me, even when I get to Dynegy should you have any 
questions!  Constance has all my contact information.  After tonight my 
access will be disconnected to the system.  My personal email address is:  
pettewayg@excite.com.

Take care.

The sentence reads:  ""The LB CRAC does apply to Slice purchases and the 1,000

the proposed correction is revise the final phrase of the sentence to read:  
""..., including where such power sales are converted cash payments calculated

Section 5(b) references conversion of power sales to cash at the mid-C index

calculated off the ""CRAC'd"" RL rate.

ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=

If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficult

		 Subject: California Update 7/25/01 p.3

Details are still rough and the situation is very fluid, but here is what is 
currently going on:

Senators Hertzberg and Keeley are amending both SB 78XX and AB 82XX.  Upon an 
initial read, it appears that they are doing the following:
? AB 82XX has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the 
renewables portfolio.  (The core/non-core business provisions, the 
transmission asset purchase, etc. all appear to have been deleted.)  Both of 
these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by 
members last week when the bill was first debated. 
? It appears amendments have been made to SB 78XX but the extent of these 
changes are not yet known.  
? At the beginning of both amended bills, it states, ""As proposed to be 
amended into SB_XX.""   This means that amendments to SB 78 could be 
incorporated into AB 82, and vice versa.  Another possibility is an entirely 
new bill.

Attached is a memo from Doak Bishop analyzing Enron's claims under our 
political risk insurance for expropriation of TGS resulting from the stamp 
tax.  We are asserting in our suit against Argentina, that the tax assessment 
is an expropriation prior to payment because it affects our equity in the 
company.  In other words, any attempt to dispose of the asset would require 
disclosure of this massive assessment which significantly impairs the value.  
Doak and I met with our expert in international law, Professor Michael 
Reisman of Yale who believes and will testify that this is a valid claim.  
Therefore under the policy, we arguably have an immediate claim for 
expropriation against OPIC, even though we haven't paid any money. To avoid 
waiving any claims, we will prepare a letter to OPIC requesting a tolling 
agreement, so we do not have to file a claim or arbitration against it within 
the period required under the policy, pending resolution of the matter.  
Given the nature of our call with them this morning, I'm sure they will 
cooperate.

I will arrange a call with Guido Tawil, our local counsel in Argentina to 
review the PPI issue, and we will analyze the commercial policy to see if we 
can find any coverage there.
Kind regards,
Michelle

		 Subject: Baltimore Gas & Electric v. Enron Federal Solutions

In a 48-page opinion issued on March 12, United States District Court Judge 
Andre Davis granted EFSI's motion for summary judgment and dismissed BG&E's 
lawsuit.  BG&E was seeking a ruling that nonregulated companies should not be 
permitted to provide utilty services to federal armed services bases located 
within state territory.  Along with Friday's dismissal of the Colorado suit 
brought by Colorado State Utilities, this should end this threat to EFSI's 
business.  The only judicial challenge that remains is the lawsuit filed by 
Virginia Power at the Federal Court of Claims, and the issue in that lawsuit 
relates solely to bundling.  Moreover, there is language in Judge Davis' 
decision (on the non-retroactivity of the October Hexley amendments to 
section 2688) that, if followed by the Federal Court of Claims, will be 
dispositive of that issue as well.

The Venable firm, primarily Jim Shea and Mitch Mirviss, did an outstanding 
job briefing and arguing this case.  However, as the Judge noted in his 
decision, had Congress passed the House version of the Hexley amendment, the 
Judge would have been obliged to rule in BG&E's favor.  Cynthia Sandherr and 
Bob Frank are responsible for getting the language changed in conference so 
that it ended up helping, not defeating, our case.

I will let you know if BG&E appeals.

Please call me with any questions.  Thank you.     ",shapiro-r,,,"I guess I should assert some credit for the legislative outcome is well.

from existing fossil fuel generation vs, new cleaner generation.  This chart 
is not quite there.  However, it is a rough aggregate of the NOx generated by 
all of the existing fossil fuel generation over 50 MW in CA.  The data points 
were gathered from the EPA's Acid Rain CEMs (continuous emissions monitoring) 
database.  (I am working on a chart that's message is more clear.) As you 
will see, existing generation is significantly dirtier than what new, 
combined cycle plants would be.  In fact, of the utility units in CA 
reporting under Title IV, there are a number of steam plants with NOx 
emissions of 0.1 lb/MMBtu or in some cases more.  This corresponds to about 1 
lb NOx/MWh compared to 0.056 lb/MWh for a new gas combined cycle plant.  Even 
the cleaner boilers that are at 0.05 lb/MMBtu are 10 times higher than the 
new plants on an output basis.  

In otherwords, Dave Parquet is right that there is a lot of more polluting 
generation on line, while new plants have to meet ever tighter BACT 
requirements.



In the most recent version of SB 28 it looks like there are a lot of 
provisions focusing on the retrofitting of existing generation.  I suspect, 
the regulators are well aware of the discrepancies in emissions and would 
argue that the plants are going to have to clean up in the very near future.  
I am digging for more information on these timelines.

Gus, Marc, and I felt like the main short term fixes/solutions would be:

1.  Expanding the hours of operations for back-up generators.  (As I have 
previously stated, some of the local air districts have increased the 
permitted run hours for emergency generators from 200 to 500 at only 
""essential public services."")  

2.  CA requiring offsetting of emissions at only the ratios required by 
Federal regulations.  In many cases state requirements are more stringent.

3.  The EPA allowing the concept of the pollution mitigation bank - it is 
really going to be an issue of timing - once the CA government has the funds 
to start acquiring offsets they will be able to provide them prior to the 
operation of a new generation facility, However, there is going to be some 
initial lag time where the offsets aren't in the hands of the generation 
operators (which goes against the requirements of the Clean Air Act).

4.  The Feds working with the state and local permitters to create alternate 
sources of emission offsets.  There simply aren't enough in all the air 
districts.  As I stated, in my previous memo the USEPA has allowed, under the 
NOx SIP call, emissions allowances to be given to renewable and energy 
efficiency projects. CA is going to need guidance from the USEPA in how to 
create and count alternate sources of offsets in nonattainment areas.

5.  The USEPA better defining the nonattainment air sheds and pollution 
transportation pathways.  Apparently, there is not a central model of the air 
patterns in CA.  Thus, the 35 local air districts all having different 
requirements about inter-district offsets.

However, the real issues as Dave alluded to in his memo are going to require 
modifications to the Clean Air Act.  It is pretty prescriptive about what can 
and can't be done, and there is not a whole lot of flexibility.  

Let me know if anything in here is not clear.  I'm working on refining the 
data and presentation of the data.

Subject: Gruma's call for help, re: Cal.

Marty,
I rec'd. a call from Steve Brunner this afternoon, requesting assistance from 
us regarding their California situation.  

Irwin Gordon just returned from Cal. and has many questions about the future 
direction of California's energy environment, and what Gruma's options might 
include.  Boiling it down, Irwin and his senior leadership team would like to 
meet with Enron's ""California expert"" to talk about the current and future 
scenarios, in order that Gruma can make more intelligent near-term 
decisions.  They would like to do this next week if at all possible.

FYI, we have already had several conversations with Steve over the past week 
pertaining to our current posture in California, and I've furnished him with 
the letter we sent to our customers, and the PowerPoint slides prepared for 
meetings on the subject.  While these were helpful, Gruma's response was ""not 
enough depth...didn't answer all of our questions.""

Steve gave me a good overview of Gruma's questions and issues which I can 
discuss further with you or whomever you designate to meet with Gruma.

Let me know if I can further clarify.
George

1.  EnronOnline supports Enron's Wholesale Services division.  In 2000, IBIT (Income before interest, minority interests and taxes) for Enron Wholesale Services division rose 72% to $2.3 billion, with record physical energy volumes of 51.7 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (TBtue/d) -- a 59% increase over 1999.  Both of these growth rates were very significantly higher than growth rates we experienced in previous years.  For example, for the past five years, wholesale services earnings have grown at an average compunded growth rate of 48% annually.

2.  It took nearly a decade for Enron's daily gas transactions in North America to reach 13.9 bcf in 1999.  Just 12 months later, EnronOnline had helped to practically double daily transactions to 24.7 Bcf.

Thanks for the message and the great experience at Harvard last week!  Harvard's hospitality was the best!!

I'm travelling right now and only have a minute, but I've passed along your request to Louise and will follow up with her and the totality of your request on  Monday. ( I also told Louise she was a ""star in absentia"" at Harvard last week!!!)

Take care and we'll speak soon!

Best!

--Christie.

Subject:	Enron Online case


Christie:

Following up on my message of last week, I have now finished the minor
edits required to clarify the Enron Online case (correcting the stock
price, clarifying the ""One to Many"" versus ""Many to Many"" models of
trading, etc.).  The one piece that remains for me to insert is some
information that will allow the students to make some estimates about the
economic risk involved in this bold move.  I know that wholesale services
contributed about 89% of Enron's total profit in 1999, but it is unclear
what extent of this was provided by the traditional trading activities that
subsequently were enhanced by Enron Online. My suspicion is that it is the
majority of the sales volume, and perhaps the majority of profitability,
but if we could give some clue to that in the case, it would be
helpful.  This might simply be that ""trading activities constituted the
majority of wholesale services profits"" or ""the vast majority"" or ""over
80%"" or whatever you think would give the students some sense of
quantification.  The alternative might be to provide data that was
disguised and could be footnoted as such.  For example, we could identify
that trading contributed ""over $750 million to Enron's net profits"" with
that number footnoted as a disguised figure.

The other thing that would be very helpful would be again to provide some
data on the profitability of operations in 1999 versus the profitability in
2000 when Enron Online became a dominant part of its activities.  Once
again, we could include broad-level generalizations or disguised
data.  It's your choice, but it will give the students a sense of the size
of the issue facing them.

If it is helpful to talk about this in person, please feel free to call me
on 617-495-6308 today (Thursday); or tomorrow (Friday) in the afternoon at
802-457-1880.

Once again, thanks so much not only for the cooperation on the case, but
also for the terrific organization you did in getting your executive team
up here for last week's classes.  I think you probably realized that it was
a ""home run"" with the students, who are still talking about it.

Best wishes,
Chris

<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>",kitchen-l,,,"Chris -- In response to your e-mail, here are some quantitative facts that will give your students some insights about the scope of the economic return created by EnronOnline. 

1.  EnronOnline supports Enron's Wholesale Services division.  In 2000, IBIT (Income before interest, minority interests and taxes) for Enron Wholesale Services division rose 72% to $2.3 billion, with record physical energy volumes of 51.7 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (TBtue/d) -- a 59% increase over 1999.  Both of these growth rates were very significantly higher than growth rates we experienced in previous years.  For example, for the past five years, wholesale services earnings have grown at an average compunded growth rate of 48% annually.

2.  It took nearly a decade for Enron's daily gas transactions in North America to reach 13.9 bcf in 1999.  Just 12 months later, EnronOnline had helped to practically double daily transactions to 24.7 Bcf.  

 If you have any questions on this, please call me at 713 853 9354.  Thanks

Steve:  Did Hennigan give you any timetable for getting back to you on 
settlement?  We will need to follow up quickly.

See below.  Farallon has moved for summary judgment against Natwest, McDonald,
and PaineWebber.  If the motion is credible, it should ratchet up the pressure
on those three defendants to settle.  Assuming that we don't want to be the
only defendant at trial (or one of two, SDI being the other), we need to
follow the settlement negotiations as closely as we can and try to get in
(while appearing uninterested), or make a separate deal, at the last minute.

The key to getting current information on settlement efforts by the other
defendants is Mike Diamond.  Because Mike still wants Richard's business, and
Mike and I are close, Mike is likely to be pretty forthcoming if Richard or I
ask him what is going on.

The Wall Street Journal Europe
Two Utilities In California Suffer Under Deregulation --- Wholesale Power 
Costs Them More Than They Can Charge 
By Rebecca Smith 
? 
09/27/2000 
The Wall Street Journal Europe 
8           
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 

California's two biggest utilities are losing so much money buying 
electricity in the state's deregulated market that they've run up deficits 
equivalent to half their net worth in just four months.

If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price utilities are 
allowed to bill their customers, it's conceivable they could become 
technically insolvent sometime next year, putting pressure on regulators to 
orchestrate a multibillion-dollar public bailout. 

Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond rating agencies that 
recently reduced their credit outlooks for Pacific Gas and Electric Co., a 
unit of San Francisco-based PGOCorp., and Southern California Edison, a unit 
of Edison International of Rosemead, California. Bond rating agencies say 
they're not sure how much additional debt can be borne by the two affected 
utilities before they'll have difficulty paying their bills.

""If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can get through it,"" 
says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch IBCA ""If it goes on for six or nine 
months, it's a very serious situation.""

A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service, said, ""At 
some point, you have a financial crisis.""

The utilities say they're having no difficulty meeting expenses and don't 
envision problems in servicing their debts. But they're vigorously lobbying 
state and federal regulators to change the rules of the game, hoping to 
somehow charge their customers for the shortfall. As such, California's 
experience may be a harbinger of what could happen in other states where 
wholesale power prices have surpassed the amount utilities are allowed to 
charge their rate payers.

Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from what was expected when 
California deregulated its energy market on March 31, 1998. California tried 
to give its utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating faster 
than other states and by creating a mechanism to allow investor-owned 
utilities, like PGOand Edison, to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve 
customers under the old regulatory system.

To do this, the state legislature set rates at high levels, which, at first 
generated fat surpluses. As the money piled up, utilities used it to pay down 
debts for generation facilities that looked like they would be unprofitable 
in the new deregulated world. By the end of June, PGO and Edison together had 
collected more than $12 billion (13.75 billion euros) and were on track to 
finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31, 2002, deadline set by 
the legislature. At that point, rate freezes were to end and retail prices 
were to fluctuate with the market.

But all that went out the window in June when wholesale power prices surged. 
Average prices at state-sanctioned energy markets were four to five times the 
prices a year earlier and three to four times the level utilities could 
charge customers.

The cash-burn rate has been so enormous at PG&E, which serves one in 20 
Americans, that analysts expect its undercollection to exceed $3 billion -- 
half its shareholder equity of $5.7 billion -- by the end of October. 
Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit of $2 billion, 
equivalent to two-thirds of its net worth of $3.2 billion.

That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the rate freeze to be able 
to pass on the real cost of electricity to consumers. But as soon as the 
freeze ends, they get clobbered. That's because they'll immediately have to 
book a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What's more, they can't use the 
proceeds from power plant sales to cover those losses; instead, with the 
freeze ending, they'll be obliged to refund that money to ratepayers. In 
PG&E's case, the refunds could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, 
the amount is $254 million.

Publicly at least, utility executives insist that a mechanism will be found 
to let them recoup the money spent on electricity. But that assumes 
politicians will be willing to change a law that protects ratepayers from 
this expense.

Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie Hoge, executive 
director for San Francisco consumer group the Utility Reform Network, says 
ratepayers shouldn't end up footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that 
benefited them before prices shot up. ""Our heart bleeds for the utilities, 
but they have more power to get the wholesale market fixed than we do,"" she 
says.

Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the legislation that 
got them into such a mess, which was drafted with their assistance. 
PGOChairman Robert Glynn says it's best not to ""overanalyze"" the ""old deal."" 
Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit down with utilities 
and construct a new agreement as ""it's in the broad interests of the state 
not to have critical energy infrastructure look like a leper.""

Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers ""mutually assured destruction"" to both 
utilities and ratepayers. Something must be done, he says, or consumers 
throughout most of the state will experience ""a San Diego-style rate shock."" 
The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas and Electric Co., ended its 
freeze a year ago and began passing wholesale power costs directly through to 
ratepayers. Legislators intervened this summer, however, and temporarily 
capped retail rates when monthly power bills nearly tripled. As a result, San 
Diego Gas and Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy, also is accumulating a 
deficit.

Mike,

Any chance we could set  a time for Jonathan and me to speak with you and 
Shankman on crude & liquids possibilities in Asia?  Also has Mike Brown and 
his group now moved under Global markets?  And lastly, any further thoughts 
on LNG?  These LNG guys showed up this week without much direction and it 
turns out the person they were going to meet with is not even here.  In 
effect, they have come to Japan to make a conference call.

ICE has started printing copyright disclaimers on the spreadsheets from which we draw the information used in the Daily ICE Comparison, so I wanted to forward a word of caution on releasing any of the information from the daily ICE competitor reports externally.

Subject: CAISO Notification:  Action Required - Scheduling Instructions in  
Preparation for Daylight Savings Time Transition 4/1/01


 Market Participants:

 Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!!

 The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
the same one used in 2000.

  CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition

  The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should
prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI)
system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on
4/1/01.

  When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for
Trade Date 4/1/01, which is considered a ""Short"" day because an hour is
lost, SC's should  schedule all 24 hours of information with the data for
HE03 being zeroed out in the template or blanked out when using the CAISO SI
Web Workspace to submit schedules.

  The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data
from/to the SI database for the ""Short"" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will
be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have
only 23 records for this ""Short"" day, Trade Date 4/1/01.

  If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade
date, please contact Ginger Seitles, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-4420.


  CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition

  The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in
PST, year around.

  Therefore, the transition to DST should require no
modification to meter data submission.

  However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data
continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.

  If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade
date, please contact  ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-4431.

 For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.

Subject: Progress on Daily Trading Ledger - note from John Paskin and Mike 
Jordan

UAT on phase 1 of this application development has identified previously 
unforeseen technical and functional requirements/issues. Consequently, a 
comprehensive re-specification and re-planning exercise for DTL has been 
completed such as to give a much later implementation timetable.

Given the immediate, and absolute, need to implement the more significant of 
the control and efficiency improvements identified in this project along with 
the competing demands for existing IT development resource we have decided to 
:-

pause development work on the DTL application ( specifically )
apply business analysis resources on the full redesign and documentation of 
ledger control and reporting processes
complete the process changes within the Trade Accounting area that have been 
on-going for the last 6 months
reassign IT resources to the Enlighten and Envoice projects
reassess the timetable for the delivery of the residual DTL control and 
efficiency improvements by re-preforming the business case for the DTL 
application following the completion of the above identified work

Please feel free to discuss any of the above issues with us

Regards

John & Mike

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Latest NFL Player News

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to
start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of
his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham
doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be
signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3
receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has
been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to
Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He
played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be
a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's
game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with
extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not
be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No.
1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He
left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the
game.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of
the regular season. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. ""We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore,"" Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes."" Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite
his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff
run. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is far too unreliable to be
considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has been solid all season. Look for him to be a good receiver
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an
adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least
200 yards and a touchdown. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to
continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Taylor is not expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a groin
injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but <i>The
Cincinnati Post</i> reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if
healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run
defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. McNair first
experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In the first
quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened
up. However, he stayed in the game. Even McNair is unsure of his status for
Saturday night. ""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,""
he said. ""I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time
the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated."" Avoid using McNair this
week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a
major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson,
who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season
with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first
quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the
game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. ""I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes,"" Mike Riley. ""But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""It's a
coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there.""
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. ""We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday,"" Dennis Green said. ""I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective.""

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take
his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Stewart (hip) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of
swelling, he should play this week, says the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. 

Aaron Shea, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to
play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for
Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is
expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Walls (ankle) particpated in some drills on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable, and Kris Mangum will start in Walls' place if he cannot play. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Muhammad (turf toe) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable and Isaac Byrd will start if Muhammad can't play.

Latest NFL Player News

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/23/01
Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to
start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb. 

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 12/23/01
Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of
his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham
doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be
signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3
receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has
been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to
Fantasy glory. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/23/01
McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He
played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be
a solid No. 1 QB.

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/23/01
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's
game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with
extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not
be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No.
1 Fantasy QB. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He
left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the
game.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/23/01
Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a
hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.

Fred Beasley, RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01
Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of
the regular season. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a
must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't
depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Donald Hayes, WR CAR - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in
place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help
Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the
weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you
need an emergency QB. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.
Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player
on many title teams, and should never be benched. 

Randy Moss, WR MIN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best
wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.

Marvin Minnis, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him
during the remaining weeks of the NFL season. 

Michael Westbrook, WR WAS - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be
a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper
league, starting Gardner isn't advisable. 

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too
talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead
your team to Fantasy glory.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start
during the rest of the season. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2
wideout during your postseason.

Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during
the Fantasy postseason. 

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2
during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.

Reggie Wayne, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not
accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid
Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2
wideout during your playoffs.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the
NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not
in the playoff race. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into
your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. 

Shawn Bryson, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider
him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch
a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be
a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs. 

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless
your team is very thin at wide receiver. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless
you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't
recommended. 

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a
reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Warrick Dunn, RB TB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best
during your playoffs. 

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his
yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD
reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your
playoffs.

Anthony Becht, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be
very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Laveranues Coles, WR NYJ - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Coles has been New York's best receiver this year. He will continue to be a
consistent TD threat during the Fantasy postseason. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Miller has been inconsistent this season. Starting Miller is too huge a
gamble in the Fantasy playoffs. 

Curtis Martin, RB NYJ - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Martin will be a key player in many Fantasy championship drives. Keep him
in your lineup throughout the rest of the season. 

Marty Booker, WR CHI - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Booker has been one of the better receivers in the NFC. Look for him to
produce solid numbers in the Fantasy postseason. 

Chris Chambers, WR MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Chambers may start this week because Oronde Gadsden will be less than 100
percent healthy with a hamstring injury. He will continue to be a regular
TD threat during the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs. 

Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too
much during the Fantasy playoffs.

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 12/21/01
Plummer has played well this season. He should be an adequate QB during the
Fantasy playoffs. 

Ricky Williams, RB NO - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Williams (ribs) is now listed as probable. He has been practicing with no
apparent problems. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
According to the <i>Pro Football News and Injury Report</i>, Davis' status
for Sunday's game is questionable right now. He has told reporters he will
play, but Ki-Jana Carter will start in his place if Davis can't play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Hakim has a sore back. He is expected to play against Carolina. 

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Faulk has a minor knee problem. He is listed as probable for this week's
game. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
Bruce (foot) missed Thursday's practice. He is listed as probable for this
week. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Owens (hip) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Garcia (ribs) returned to practice on Thursday. ""We didn't do too much with
him but just enough to make him feel somewhat confident about making
progress this week. The important thing will be how he feels tomorrow, does
he become real sore,"" Steve Mariucci told the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""I
didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing. I saw him throw a
couple of frozen ropes."" Garcia is expected to play this week. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Bouman worked on a limited basis in practice on Thursday. There is a chance
Spergon Wynn may start in his place this week, and that decision may be
made on Friday. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 12/21/01
Parker may miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. He has not been a
reliable Fantasy player this year when healthy. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Holmes returned to practice on Thursday. He should assume his regular
workload this week. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Franks (ankle) has returned to practice. He is expected to play on Sunday. 

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Gadsden (hamstring) has returned to practice, but Chris Chambers may start
over him this week. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Muhammad (toe) did not practice on Thursday. He might miss the game against
Buffalo, and Isaac Byrd will start in his place if Muhammad can't play. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Walls (ankle) practiced on Thursday. He might be able to play against
Buffalo. 

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Price (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. He is expected to play this
week. 

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Wycheck started off slow this season but has been productive in recent
weeks. Expect him to contribute a fair amount of points during the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
Christian missed practice with tightness in his calf on Thursday. His
current status is day to day. 

Eddie George, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
George is listed as questionable for Saturday's game because of an ankle
injury, but is expected to play. Look for him to be productive this week
against a weak Raider run defense. 

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason.
He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/21/01
Mason is expected to play Saturday, despite suffering from a hip injury.
Look for him to be an adequate No. 2 wideout. 

Hines Ward, WR PIT - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Ward hasn't scored a lot of touchdowns this season but is among the league
leaders in receptions. He should be an asset to your team for the rest of
the season as a No. 2 wideout. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Burress has been more reliable in recent weeks but still remains a risky
pick for the Fantasy playoffs. He will only be a good No. 2 wideout at
best. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. Don't expect
him to be too productive during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 12/21/01
Mack has produced an adequate amount of all-purpose yardage but hasn't
scored a lot. He should be used in larger leagues only for the remaining
weeks. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
McCardell has caught a lot of passes this season but he doesn't score too
many touchdowns. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 receiver in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 12/21/01
Smith has been one of the best receivers in the AFC this season, despite
his offseason injury. The veteran is a must-start for your Fantasy playoff
run. 

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 12/21/01
Couch has been inconsistent this season. He is far too unreliable to be
considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/21/01
Johnson has been solid all season. Look for him to be a good receiver
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Elvis Grbac, QB BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an
adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least
200 yards and a touchdown. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 12/21/01
Ismail has been a reliable receiver all season. Look for this trend to
continue throughout the Fantasy playoffs. 

Fred Taylor, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 12/21/01
Taylor is not expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a groin
injury that has sidelined him for most of the season. 

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 12/21/01
Dillon missed practice Thursday because of a finger injury but <i>The
Cincinnati Post</i> reports that he is expected to play Sunday. Even if
healthy, Dillon is a risky start this week against a tough Baltimore run
defense. Consider benching him if you have a backup of equal value. 

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
Kitna, still recovering from a finger injury, is not at full strength. He
will start Sunday but has not been productive enough to use in the Fantasy
playoffs. 

Scott Covington, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01
The Bengals have signed Covington to their roster. Covington will backup
Jon Kitna this week. However, Covington is not worth using even if he
receives playing time. 

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 12/21/01
Brunell is expected to play Sunday. He is still suffering from a quadriceps
injury that has limited his abilities over the past month. 

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/21/01
McNair missed practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back
spasms and is questionable for the game against Oakland. McNair first
experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In the first
quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles tightened
up. However, he stayed in the game. Even McNair is unsure of his status for
Saturday night. ""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,""
he said. ""I'm very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time
the spasms have stayed longer than I anticipated."" Avoid using McNair this
week if you have a backup of equal value. His health status makes him a
major risk. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 12/21/01
The Cleveland Browns put Jackson on injured reserve on Thursday. Jackson,
who leads the team with 554 yards rushing, will miss the rest of the season
with an ankle injury. He aggravated a left ankle sprain in the first
quarter of Sunday's defeat against the Jacksonville Jaguars and left the
game with two carries for six yards. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White will
share carries in his absence, but neither are reliable players to use
during the Fantasy playoffs. 

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Drew Brees, QB SD - President Taft Updated 12/20/01
There still seems to be a chance Brees might play this week or before the
season ends, says the <i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i>. He has been taking
snaps with the first team in practice. ""I'm not going to say that he will
play, (but) could he play? Yes,"" Mike Riley. ""But I'm not going to say he
will for sure. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Despite scoring on two short TD runs last week, Barlow is not offically the
Niners' goal-line back, says the <i>Contra-Costa Times</i>. ""It's a
coincidence,"" Barlow said. ""It was my turn in the rotation to be in there.""
The two backs will continue to split carries. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Owens (hip) did not practice on Wednesday. He is still expected to play
this week. 

Jeff Garcia, QB SF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 12/20/01
Garcia (ribs) has been downgraded to questionable, but he still expects to
play this week. Tim Rattay took snaps with the first team on Wednesday. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
The <I>New York Daily News</i> says the pain in Hilliard's toe has
worsened. He aggravated the injury in Week 14, but he is expected to play
against Seattle. 

Santana Moss, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Moss (quadriceps) has returned to practice. He might be able to play this
week.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 12/20/01
McNair has missed some practice time this week because of a back injury. He
is still expected to start. 

Todd Bouman, QB MIN - Grid Iron Goons Updated 12/20/01
Bouman (thumb) missed practice on Wednesday. He is expected to play this
week, although the <i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune</i> says he might have to
throw in pain. ""We think he'll be practicing full speed on Thursday and
Friday,"" Dennis Green said. ""I think he'll get accustomed to how he's got
to throw the ball and I think he will be effective.""

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Wilkins will sit out again this week with a hamstring injury. Reggie Wayne
will be the No. 2 receiver against the Jets. 

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 12/20/01
McKnight is listed as probable for this week's game with a back injury. He
is expected to play against New England. 

Larry Foster, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Foster (thigh) might not be able to play this week. Bert Emanuel may take
his place as Detroit's No. 2 receiver. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 12/20/01
Stewart (hip) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 12/20/01
Emanuel returned to practice on Wednesday. If his knee shows no sign of
swelling, he should play this week, says the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>. 

Aaron Shea, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Shea did not participate in team drills on Wednesday. He is not expected to
play this week, and O.J. Santiago will start in his place. 

Scott Mitchell, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Mitchell strained his right rib cage on Wednesday. He is doubtful for
Sunday's game, and now Kevin Thompson will back up Jon Kitna, who is
expected to start although he still has a finger injury. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 12/20/01
Walls (ankle) particpated in some drills on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable, and Kris Mangum will start in Walls' place if he cannot play. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01
Muhammad (turf toe) did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as
questionable and Isaac Byrd will start if Muhammad can't play.

Earlier this year, Enron filed an application for a Presidential Permit to build a 300 MW HVDC tie between Ercot and Mexico in the Brownsville area. The Permit has not yet been issued.

If the Permit is issued (as we expect), then the earliest construction could start would be sometime in the first quarter of next year.

I you need any further information, please let me know.

I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  

The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?
  
Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie?  
Do we have any construction in progress?  
Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?

Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?

Vince/Shirley:

I regret to inform that I am terminating my job with Enron today 12/06/2001. Despite the later events I had a great time working with everyone in this company. More particularly, I will miss a lot of the excitement and learning opportunities that The Research propitiated in this last 3 years.

I will be pursuing new opportunities in a different company and as soon as I settle I will inform my new contact info. I will still be residing here in Houston I and I am looking forward to continuing nurturing the friendship we developed throughout these years.

Many thanks.

RAC and Risk Ops are in this together and of course we'll continue to help in

accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits.

I think the confusion here is  violation explanations being ""validated"" by 
the traders as you indicated below, vs. ""provided"" by the traders as we 
envision.  I confirmed with Ted, the traders are accountable for providing 
the explanation.  I'm not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back 
to your efforts of getting memos out earlier.  We're suggesting the traders 
should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning, so that you 
do not have to go through all the effort as you do now, of trying to track 
people down in the afternoon and get explanations.  It should be the traders 
responsibility to get them to you, and they should be reviewing their 
positions every morning before they even begin trading., and should be able 
to easily explain why they're in violation or why they had a big loss.  
Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail, or they 
talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you 
- whatever you think makes sense and works for you.   I'm not trying to 
manage the process, just to help design one that makes it easier for you and 
is still effective from a risk management stand point.

At this point in this long series of e-mails, why don't we just talk face to 
face.  I can tell from your response you feel we're somehow not being team 
players, but that is not my intent at all.  I've tried to go out of my way 
the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and 
appreciates your efforts.  And really, I thought I was helping by using the 
policy's influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the 
time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting.  

Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate.  We can talk 
about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RAC's 
expectations.  I agree, we do have significant mid-office needs, and you have 
been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC;  
and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk 
reporting is required every day by Skilling.  We can continue to work on 
streamlining processes, but maybe we need to think about staffing in our 
respective groups and corresponding responsibilities.  I'm willing to do 
whatever is needed, and I don't think Ted is hung up on who does what 
either.  It's just that right now we're staffed with the expectation that 
Sally's group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of 
activities related to our risk management systems.

Cassandra.

Subject: Re: Limit Violations and Notifications Process  

Dear Cassandra,

Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and the 
individual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by the 
traders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been very 
helpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause of 
violations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spirit 
attitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussed 
earlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier, 
and this is a real set back to that process.

Thoughts?

Subject: Limit Violations and Notifications Process

Shona -

To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template 
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group 
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your 
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised 
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until 
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L 
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday 
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should 
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business 
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.

Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation 
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that 
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is 
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the 
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops 
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these 
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit 
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance 
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit 
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback 
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like 
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just 
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their 
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long 
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and 
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based 
on the market moves, etc.. 

Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Dear Cassandra,

In looking at the comments below there are several errors made buy us, one in 
the template itself, and some suggestions.  At your request, we have started 
to prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memos 
and our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it would 
be helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out to 
ensure it meets your requirements.

Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.

Thanks,

Shona

Subject: 12/5 Limit Violations and Notifications - Comments

I realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we should 
correct  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay's (and 
Buy's) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just hand 
deliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted, 
David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes as 
well.


The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that would 
have been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to report 
it, don't use ""WSCC"", try to spell out or just don't use)
UK Gas's VaR limit is not $4, it's $7.5MM
I can't tie in UK Gas' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn't it be what's on the DPR, 
adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - call 
over to that Yeo person and get the info. from them please
The 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn't be listed like that as it looks like 
another violation - the comment re: the VaR increase was mean to go at the 
bottom under RAC comments
The Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it's 
115% (notification requirement box)
EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation
Let's have the ""Re:"" say ""Limit Violations and Notifications for December 5, 
2000""
Let's number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each level


Veronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.

Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they're 
getting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: Liquidated Damages Pertaining to May 11 Gas Day


 Matt

 I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

 Thanks

We are missing:

Positive spin at front
Governor Davis is committed to solving the California energy crisis by:
Developing consumer driven solutions
Protecting customers from short term market aberrations
Continuing to expand the consumers ability to choose
We are missing thoughtful Orderly Process
Maintain 1890 in interim
All customers treated the same
Would replace ""maintain a reliable distribution network"" with ""assure 
investment community""
Assurances around forward purchases
Assurances around prudent purchases to keep lights
Assurances, if needed through increases, via tax refundable.
Maintain AB1890 until orderly process arrives with better solution
Would drop specifics arount rate increase. 

More to come......

I am forwarding this in order for the team to focus on the naphtha issue.  
Please note that:

As Phase II comes on line, Blocks B and C will first have to run on naphtha 
for a period of 3-6 months
This will hit us some time in 2001, hence is a more urgent issue than LNG, 
which is still a year away
If there are delays in the commissioning of the Regas terminal, the period on 
naphtha could further prolong
The naphtha market is more volatile than the crude market, and is not as 
deep, hence we need to take small positions early on to test the market
DPC Board has already approved a Risk Management Policy that allows for 
hedging.  We may need to look into options that are costless (selling put and 
buying call) to begin with, and test while only Block A is in place.
Close coordination will be required on this with the Global Markets group, 
and I propose someone like Anshuman should actually be seconded onto the group
A whole plan on tools to manage the fuel risk need to be worked in close 
coordination with the team on the ground

These are just some of my thoughts.  With 50% of the tariff being fuel price 
dependent, this is an area that requires close attention.

Sandeep.

Subject: Naphtha hedge for 2001

Current level of naphtha prices and the crude futures curve being 
backwardated provide an opportune time for DPC to enter into a hedge for all 
or a portion of its naphtha requirements for the year 2001.  We (EFI) would 
like to explore this possibility before this situation passes.  Please 
advise.  Best regards,

How to open the database in Notes:

Click [Open]

I may have mentioned this a long time ago and then forgotten about it but I'd like to coordinate with the group that administers eRequest so that this becomes a requestable app on eRequest. Someone would then be able to make a request for access to the db and you'd have to approve it. The eRequest group would then be responsible for giving them access. That way, you don't have to wait on me.

Pam,

Attached is a file that calculates the average salary over the last 5 years based information provided by payroll.  If all five years were not available, then the average is based on the number of years available (i.e. 3 years of information received from payroll, then average is total salary divided by 3).  See the worksheet labeled average calc to find the calculation of the 2.99.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  The highlighted employees are those that US payroll did not have any information.  I noted in the comment column that they were Canadian employees or UK.  I checked with Tim Callahan and Richard Lewis is not an expat.

Subject:	Capital Book

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:

Regarding a ""hedge fund meeting"" next week, I have spoken with most of the 
likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you 
in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend:

Fred Lagrasta
Caroline Abramo
Robyn Zivic
Russell Dyk
you 
Brent
me

I believe that we have a mushrooming ""process"" issue.  I also believe that 
the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion 
with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are 
none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations 
are that all hedge funds need not be ""last minute"" deals, Caroline can be our 
ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal 
sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is 
currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.

Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

The current schedule contemplates sending a draft of the Disclosure Schedules 
to Skadden by the end of the day on Friday.  Please provide any remaining 
comments to the draft Schedules as soon as you can.  I realize there will 
still be some holes, as we continue to negotiate the Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  No doubt it would help to have the Appendices to the Purchase and 
Sale Agreement completed, or say maybe a dollar amount or two completed in 
the Definitions section.  Thanks for all the help.  Lance.

Subject: 1999 NNG & TW Audited Financial Statements

Heather Mueck (AA) advised me this morning that in spite of our recent letter 
order from the FAO by Jim Guest, AA still does not believe we have enough 
evidence (other than our own opinion) to justify regulatory asset treatment 
for the Y2K costs.  While this position is consistent with what they had told 
us before we made the filing, they had given us no clue last week when they 
were providing their comments on our browncover drafts that they still had a 
problem with the Y2K assets--even when they were relaying Roger Willard's 
comments.

The bottom line is that they will have a PAJE on Northern for the amount of 
the asset  (aproximately $3.6MM), but the amount on TW (less than $.5MM) is 
so small they will pass on it.  As I understand it, that won't preclude a 
clean opinion on NNG this year, but the PAJE will continue in future years' 
audits until the asset is approved for recovery in Northern's next general 
rate case.  Therefore, if we have additional Northern PAJE's in future years, 
the combined effect would be used to determine whether or not a clean opinion 
would be appropriate in those years.

I assume we will suffer the scarlet letter of the multi-year PAJE, rather 
than write off the reg asset in the 1999 Brown Cover and be required to flow 
the write-off through consolidated earnings (and internal scorekeeping) in 
the year 2000.

Subject: Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department


 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Hi,

This is the original quote for this project and it did not include the 
postage. As soon as I have the details from the vendor, I'll forward those to 
you.
Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Hi,

We have recieved the quotes from the vendors and the details are:

1 . 150 Cd's with Black printing and the plastc jewel cases - $ 886.50
2 . The distribution cost (minimum for 500 CD's)   - $ 355.00
     This will include the padded envelope, the address labels, the packing 
and deliver to the post office, but the postage is not included. 
3 . The time for Coordination, Artwork and the inserts output and trimming - 
$ 770.00

So the total amount is approx. $2,011.50. The total time would be about 8 
days. These are approximate figures only.

If you have any questions you can call Karen Hunter at X56228. or I can be 
reached at X55706.

Thanks,
Shweta.

Steve, I believe we discussed your attendance at the April 15-17 NAM board 
meeting at Loews Ventana Canyon (Tucson, AZ), in so far as Jeff is not 
available these dates.  Please confirm that you are attending in his place,

Subject: Raptor Hedges

I thought I'd communicate to the group some recent developments.

1. Gordon and Ryan advise that the swaps for assets in JEDI 1 and 2 will 
cover our proportionate economic interest in the asset within JEDI. Gordon 
believes the spreadsheet of proposed swaps reflects this. The swap will be 
between Harrier and Talon and there will be no back-to-back swap with JEDI. 
There should be no required disclosures to CalPERS resulting from these 
hedges. 

2. Gordon and Ryan advise that for assets currently on our balance sheet that 
are hedged with Raptor and then sold to Condor,  there will be no reduction 
in the hedge or any back-to-back hedge when it moves into Condor. The swap 
will be between Harrier and Talon.

3. Mark Taylor and Bob Baird have concluded that the swaps can be terminable 
by Harrier if the underlying security is sold.

		 Subject: Kern River Bid Letter

Mark,  Attached is the letter agreement we discussed.  Please review.  It is 
rough.    



Some issues to note:

1.  The Kern PA cannot be assigned without their consent, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.  If Kern didn't like the fact that we are receiving 
assignment from 3 or 4 other shippers, they might withhold consent if they 
thought we were superceding their bid procedures.  Not sure if they would, 
but it is a risk.

2.  If the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport 
agreement, Kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release 
at max rate.  

3.  I took a stab at the mark-to-market calculation.  Probably needs more 
substance though.

Lets discuss.",nemec-g,,,"Attached for your review is a draft letter for third parties whom with we

Subject: The Cave 

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours in this conflict but we've
finally come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for
putting up the poster that says ""There is no I in team"" as well as the one
that says ""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while we
are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly
I have a few concerns. 
First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we
should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you
don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily.

I've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening. 
Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're
taping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while
we're taping. Thanks. 
Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,
especially after mealtime. We're all in this together. 
Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote ""Osama"" on
the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone.
Consideration. That's all I'm saying. 
Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying
to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First
patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and the new guy Richard. 

Love you lots.

Subject:	Possible Fuel change August 1

Raetta - Could you please forward this to everyone in market services?
Rosemary - Could you please forward this to everyone in Marketing?

As you may already know, on July 10, NNG again filed with FERC to update our fuel rates in line with our annual PRA
(docket RP01-395).  We filed the same rates that were set up for June 1, then pulled when FERC suspended them for 5 months, pending a Technical Conference.  The new filing asks for the rates to be effective August 1 and has requested FERC approval by July 27 to facilitate early nominations for August business.  After discussing the rate changes with our customers, we are hopeful that the latest filing will be approved.

I do not expect to update the Rate Matrix on the EBB or to load the rates into the system until we receive FERC approval.
The next FERC meeting is Wednesday, July 25.  

If customers want to see the proposed rates, they can consult our Tariff, sheets 54 (fuel & UAF), 54A (exception points), and 61-64 (transport fuel) on the EBB under ""Proposed"" with Effective Date ""August 1, 2001"".

Today's focus: Think thin

By Phil Hochmuth

Enterprise users looking to deploy thin client technology with
Linux should be aware of a new product released last week
called WinConnect from Thin Computing.

The software allows a Linux-based PC or terminal to connect to
a Microsoft Windows server. WinConnect software would be
installed on a Linux-based PC with a minimum of 16M bytes of
RAM, a 486 processor or higher, a network connection, X-Windows
and at 400K bytes of storage for the WinConnect software. The
software allows the Linux terminal to access applications and
files on servers running Windows NT 4 Terminal Server or a
Windows 2000 Server.

Like any terminal/server setup, all applications and files
accessed by end users reside on the server. According to Thin
Computing, the software could be used to recycle older PC
hardware as Linux terminals, and allow access to applications
such as Microsoft Office on a central server. The company also
bills the product as a cheaper alternative to deploying Windows
CE or Citrix for larger enterprise terminal server projects. A
version of the software is also available to allow Linux-based
PDAs to access Windows server data.

The idea is kind of the reverse of the open source program
Samba used to allow Windows-based clients to access files and
programs on Linux servers. However, unlike Samba, the software
is neither free, nor open source.

Rod and crew,

In speaking with Jayshree, I think Mitch and Jeff would like to divide the information into categories i.e legal information (environmental disclosures, etc.) regulatory information, financial/accounting (I think we have a lot of this and I will try to get it organized), any relevant tax information, etc.  I know this is a lot but let me know what you think, who I should coordinated with, etc.

Thanks

Jim,

We made some grammar  and cosmetic changes... here is the latest version.   Also, we modified the meaning of bullet three (page 3) and added appendix 1.

Do you want to change the title?

Subject: Ireland vs Iran



Subject: IRAN vs. IRELAND

Saddam Hussein was sitting in his office wondering whom to invade next when
his telephone rang.

""Hallo! Mr. Hussein,"" a heavily accented voice said. ""This is Paddy down
at the Harp Pub in County Sligo, Ireland. I am ringing to inform you that we
are officially declaring war on you!""

""Well, Paddy,"" Saddam replied, ""This is indeed important news! How big is
your army?""

""Right now,"" said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, ""there is myself,
my cousin Sean, my next door neighbour Seamus, and the entire dart team from
the pub. That makes eight!""

Saddam paused. ""I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my
army waiting to move on my command.""

""Begorra!"", said Paddy. ""I'll have to ring you back!""

Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. ""Mr. Hussein, the war is
still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!""

""And what equipment would that be, Paddy?"" Saddam asked.

""Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor.""

Saddam sighed. ""I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and
14,000 armored personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1-1/2
million since we last spoke.""

""Saints preserve us!"" said Paddy. ""I'll have to get back to you.""

Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. ""Mr. Hussein, the war is
still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We've modified
Harrigan's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four
boys from the Shamrock pub have joined us as well!""

Saddam was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. ""I must tell
you, Paddy, that I have 10,000 bombers and 20,000 fighter planes. My
military complex is surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. 
And
since we last spoke, I've increased my army to TWO MILLION!""

""Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!"", said Paddy, ""I'll have to ring you back.""

Sure enough, Paddy called again the next day. ""Top o' the mornin', Mr.
Hussein! I am sorry to tell you that we have had to call off the war.""

""I'm sorry to hear that,"" said Saddam. ""Why the sudden change of heart?""

""Well,"" said Paddy, ""we've all had a long chat over a bunch of pints, and
there's no way we can feed two million prisoners.""

ESA, EECC and Finance Teams,

Attached for your review is the Electrobolt EPC Contract (our doc # 
39444.04), which incorporates the negotiated provisions of the Electrobolt 
MOU.  To assist you in your review, I have also attached (1) a blackline of 
the Electrobolt EPC marked to show all changes from the RioGen EPC Contract 
distributed October 17, and (2) a blackline of the Electrobolt EPC marked to 
show all revisions to the EECC form EPC contract.

Please note that the comparison document, prepared by DeltaView, shows new 
text in blue double underscore, deleted text in red strikethrough, and moved 
text in green (double underscore at the new location, strikethrough from 
where moved).

Please call if you have questions/comments.

Dan,

Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL, please coordinate with Clement 
to issue a new guaranty.  As you recall, Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation 
has $50MM of exposure from HPL and they have requested additional security 
above the amount in the current guaranty listing HPL (gty2846.doc).  Please 
issue a new guaranty for HPL covering Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation for 
physical natural gas in the amount of $50MM.  In addition, please put 
language in this guaranty which would amend the existing guaranty 
(gty2846.doc) that would remove HPL. 

Thank you,

Russell

Subject: Enron Online Japan - Tax Issues =20

I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their=
=20
final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese=
=20
trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20
summary of their advice:

A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions
1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=
=20
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that=
=20
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput=
ed=20
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta=
x.

2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes

Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=
re=20
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20
imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t=
he=20
subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such=
=20
excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and=
=20
delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20
financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices.

3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions

If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=
=20
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.

B. Physically Settled Transactions
1. Consumption Tax

Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an=
d=20
on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab=
le=20
to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit=
e,=20
including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20
paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20
provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20
Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base=
d=20
customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20
capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a=
nd=20
then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20

If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20
commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20
required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20
consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a=
n=20
arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20
resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption=
=20
tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer.

2. Excise Tax

Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20
commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum=
=20
products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon=
=20
the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20
coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20
petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t=
o=20
excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities=
=20
before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a=
nd=20
has responsibility for payment of excise taxes.

C. Tax Representations

The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20
Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in=
=20
force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20
entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20
representations may provide that:

(1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl=
y=20
and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and
(2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20
entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article=
=20
of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in=
=20
the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20


Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati=
on=20
or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t=
o you.

Best regards,
Susan

Greetings!  Wow, I'm back, its hard to believe.  Sitting at my desk trying
to get used to being here in the office and having people shout hey Mrs.
Ruppert is kind of freaky too.  I'm ready for my afternoon siesta which
I've
become accustomed to in the last couple weeks.

Well I must say the honeymoon was amazing!  Everything I could have wanted
and just what we needed. We truly had a wonderful time.  The trip there was

quite exhausting especially after the wedding and all.  we got settled into

Athens around 4 p.m. Monday.  Our hotel had a balcony which had a wonderful

view of the Acropolis.  Athens is pretty dirty and the Greeks there are
kind
of assholes, but I really didn't think it was as bad as people kept telling

me, I mean its a big city.  We did our own walking tour of all the ruins (I

try to avoid large groups of formal tours).  We took a ferry to Santorini
and stayed there for 3 days.  Loved it!  We ate some faboulous restaurants
on cliffs overlooking the water.  Lots of shrimp, squid, lamb, vegetables,
bread and of course my favorite THE WINE! We rented a car one day and drove

all over the entire island stopping periodically at various beaches to
absorb the rays.  Unfortunately we hadn't anticipated laying out so we
didn't bring swimsuits.  As being the sport I am I wanted to be apart of
the
culture so I took the rays in in just my briefs.  Ryan surprisingly left
his
shorts on this time???  Loved the black beaches!  We tried to find a more
private beach to partake in some skinny dipping, but were busted at our
attempt.  We went to an area called Oia on Santorini, which was amazing.
We
drove down the mountain and at the bottom there was this bay area enclosed
in rock with a few tavernas.  so we had dinner there and watched the
sunset.
  The most amazing seafood!  They took us in their kitchen to show us what
they had caught that day. We also took a boat out to the volcano at Ryan's
request being a geologist and all.  We hiked 2 1/2 miles all uphill and
then
of course back down.  We went to the hot springs which Ryan said wasn't so
hot, I did not venture in the water.  After the ride we had to get all the
way back to the top so we took donkeys of course.  Quite an adventure as we

were weaving around these narrow paths on the edge of the cliff!  Luckily
mine was tame, Ryan's however was a jackass(mmm, appropriate I thought).

We also took a ferry to Ios, which unfortunately it rained the whole day so

we stayed inside, slept and later went to some bars and met some great
people which we later went out with that night.  You all should have seen
Ryan at the discos!

Our final destination was Naxos about a 2 1/2 ferry ride from Santorini.
Ate, shopped, toured the island, slept on the beach, drank, ate again and
slept.  Loved this island a lot.  Not as touristy and the greeks were very
pleasant and charming. Would have loved to stay there longer.

All in all the wedding was fabulous.  I was very happy with the wedding
festivities too.  And of course as everyone had said it went by sooo fast.

The next morning Ryan and I were so confused about what had taken place the

night before.  I cannot believe I am a married woman, its all so surreal!
The few days prior to the wedding I was so nervous and emotional about
everything!  Its just so overwhelming.  One of the best parts was sitting
on
the alter in the cathedral and looking out upon our friends and family and
people's faces lighting up.  Knowing that all those people were there to
share in our special moment was just so wonderful.  Of course I wish I
could
have spent more time chatting with each and everyone one of you.  We were
so
honored you all traveled so far for us!

I am definitely on cloud 9 now and would have to say I feel the happiest
I've ever been!  Thanks again for joining us it truly meant a lot.  I hope
you all had a wonderful time and enjoyed yourselves.  Everyone was
surprisingly on their best behavior...frankly I was a little disappointed
in
you gals!  Except for Falb she always pulls through with something!
Anyway,
love to hear from you all soon. Hope everyone is well!

Forever Gams!

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

Professor Jenny Chatman has taught both the day and evening core OB courses 
consistently earning above a 6.0.  Jenny has taught this elective course in 
the Executive Program numerous times and, again, gets consistently high

E296-5; European Financial Markets; Portes
Professor Richard Portes is visiting from London Business School.  He is an 
expert in the European Monetary Union and will spend considerable time on 
this topic.  The difference between this course and Professor Rich Lyons' 
International Finance course is that this course will focus on Europe, will 
be a bit more ""macro"", and study the institutional implications of the common

Part 1 of 2 Parts

Longhorns Find Running Game Just in Time
To Maul OSU in Big 12 Opener; OU Next Foe

The Longhorns ran over, around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys and
their No. 1-rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a 42-7 victory befor=
e
a sellout crowd in Austin.
The Cowboys, while they hadn't played a good rushing team in their first
three games, had allowed only 91 net yards rushing all season and they real=
ly
do have a pretty salty front seven.
Led by sophomore Kenny Hayter's 122 yards, the Longhorns had 205 net yards
rushing. It was the first time Texas has has 100 net rushing yards in a gam=
e
since the 58-7 thumping of Texas Tech last season.
In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the=
y
couldn't reach the century mark in rushing, it's no coincidence that they w=
on
just twice.
But they utilized a new gap-blocking technique  to combat the Cowboys'
stunting defense, and it worked to near perfection because Hayter, who was =
a
little used third-team tailback, turned a lot of little holes into big ones
with his hard running.
While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story, it didn't
happen until the second half and UT had a shaky 10-7 lead at that point.
Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlier
developments =01)  a huge passing play, a great defensive stand after still
another special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out=
 a
potentially game-turning interception.
The huge passing play, of course, was Major Applewhite's 96-yard pass-and-r=
un
connection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep into
the second half
The Horns were holding a fragile 10-7 lead at the time, they were facing a
third-and-14 and they had already had so many problems with  their punting
team that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down.
After all, coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second half
is the most crucial period in a tight game, and the first five minutes had
been all Oklahoma State. The Longhorns hadn't even made a first down since
the intermission.
But they got a lot more than that. Williams got past the Cowboy cornerback
who was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety back
toward the middle.
When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball, the only question
was whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people in
college football who can catch the fleet freshman.
He did, catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of the
way. That 96-yard play gave Texas a 17-7 lead and it was all downhill after
that for the Longhorns.
But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t=
he
Cowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage and
put OSU in possession at the UT 38, and because an interception of a Chris
Simms' pass and a long runback inside the UT 10 was negated by a personal
foul penalty against the Cowboys.
The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSU's
only touchdown. The Cowboys were leading, 7-3, and the Longhorns, at that
point, hadn't generated enough offense to indicate they could fall farther
behind.
The disallowed interception was a possible 10-point swing because OSU might
have scored with a first-and-goal inside the UT 10. Instead, the Horns kept
the ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened the
scoring.

Here, briefly, is how the game went:

FIRST QUARTER
Neither team threatened early, but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon=
d
possession. They started in good field possession, but Simms threw an
interception that was run back inside the UT 10 before a personal foul
against OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU 29. Tex=
as
couldn't move and Stockton kicked a 45-yard field goal to put the Horns
ahead, 3-0, with 7:00 left. OSU TB Reggie White broke loose for 69 yards to
the UT 11 on the Cowboys' next possession, but the UT defense held and the
Cowboys missed a chip-shot field goal try. Applewhite came in at QB for
Texas. UT led, 3-0, at the end of the quarter, but the Longhorns had only o=
ne
first down =01) on the penalty that negated the long interception return =
=01) and
just 30 yards of total offense compared to 100 for OSU.

SECOND QUARTER
The UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt. With Applewhite still in at
QB, sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs, then seni=
or
TB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for 18 yards. But
Applewhite was sacked and his third-down pass to freshman WR B. J. Johnson
was dropped. That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt, the
snap was high, a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked.
Stockton covered it at the UT 30, and OSU's White scored in two plays,
galloping 21 yard to the 9, then bursting up the middle untouched for the
score to put OSU ahead, 7-3, with  9:59 left. The next UT drive also came u=
p
short, but, facing fourth and 1 at their own 40, the Horns went with a fake
punt. It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a two-yard loss. But t=
he
strong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba=
ck
for the offense. On his third try, Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en=
d
zone, driving 80 yards in seven plays. Mitchell got the TD on a 3-yard run,
but the big plays were Applewhite's passes of 15 yards to WR Montrell
Flowers, 14 yards on third-and-9 to Johnson and 36 yards to the 3 to
Williams. Stockton's kick gave Texas a 10-7 lead with 4:23 left. OSU got
close enough to try a field goal as time expired, but Ervis Hill blocked it=
.
UT outgained OSU, 140 to 80, in the period.

THIRD QUARTER
A combination of mishaps, including a sack and a half-the-distance penalty,
left the Longhorns facing a third and 14 from their own 4. Visions of anoth=
er
punting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere, but
Applewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between double
coverage just past midfield. He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it =
on
his fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a 96-yard
touchdown play. Stockton's kick put UT ahead, 17-7, with 9:14 left. Lindsay
and White misfired on a handoff two plays later and  UT LB De'Andre Lewis
recovered for Texas at the 13. Hayter powered to the 1 to set up a
first-and-goal. He tried to go over the top, but the Cowboys stopped him,
then the Horns were penalized back to the 6 for a false start. Hayter got
three yards to the 3 off right tackle, but Applewhite's pass on third down
was knocked down and Stockton's 20-yard field goal gave Texas a 20-7 lead
with 6:03 left. Applewhite hit redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis for 21 yard=
s
and another TD with 2:11 left. A two-point conversion try failed, leaving U=
P
on top, 26-7, heading into the final period.

FOURTH QUARTER
With Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes, the
Longhorns drove 58 yards to set up a 36-yard Stockton FG and moved 42 yards
for a touchdown, with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final 2
yards, Ivan Williams ran 21 yards for the final score with 13 seconds left.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of the
season against Oklahoma State, the defense did its usual fine job and the
special teams, with one notable exception, were outstanding.
""After reviewing the film, it's clear that it was the best performance we'v=
e
had offensively,"" he said. ""We scored 42 points and we had no turnovers. Th=
e
offensive line had its best performance.""
""We were pleased with not only the offensive line, but Roy Williams made so=
me
great blocks, too, and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs.""
He also said junior QB Major Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee
surgery, ""played like the Major of old. He made very, very few mistakes.""
The Major of old was very good. He was the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the
Year as a redshirt freshman in 1998 and the Co-Offensive Player of the Year
as a sophomore in 1999.
Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB, and Sim=
ms
started the OSU game, but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter.
Applewhite completed 15 of 28 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns.
Simms, who returned late in the game, completed 3 of 5 passes for 8 yards.
Brown said the defense ""continues to swarm and play really well. Casey
Hampton is amazing and D. D. Lewis had an outstanding day. Quentin Jammer a=
nd
Rod Babers played really well. We had another blocked kick. that's our 12th
in 30 games here. I thought it was Tyrone Jones, but it was Ervis Hill who
blocked the field goal. It's interesting that our two best kick blockers ar=
e
both from Texas City.""
The special teams played well, Brown said, except for having another punt
blocked, and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed.
""The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas,"" he said, ""b=
ut
we have to get it fixed. We can't keep getting punts blocked.""
He said the UT-OU game was such a big game 15 or 20 years ago ""that the
feeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation=
al
championship."" He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops ""are trying to get back t=
o
that.""
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said SS Lee Jackson suited out against Oklahoma State
and should be ready to play against Oklahoma. He said DT Shaun Rogers
(sprained ankle) is questionable for the OU game. ""We should know more abou=
t
Shaun Tuesday,"" he said. LB O. J. McClintock also missed the OSU game
(bruised knee), but he should be back this week.
BLOCKING, QUARTERBACK NOTES: The big change in the UT running game was
basically one new play - a counter with an off side guard pulling and the
linemen blocking down on the play side. The QB also handed off at least par=
t
of the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a little
bit of misdirection. . . Major Applewhite's knee has been one of he major (=
no
pun intended) reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much in
the early games. Applewhite still isn't 100%, but he's getting closer every
week. In fact, he looked pretty close to 100% Saturday. That's just in time
because the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two top
quarterbacks ready to go.

Baseball Recruiting Going Great

The UT  baseball coaches got a commitment last week from right-handed pitch=
er
Donald Lavinski, 6-4, 205, of Class AA state champion Weimar, giving them
pledges from two of the state's big three pitching recruits. They also got =
a
pledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen, 6-0, 175, of Forney.
Round Rock's Joey Guajardo, another right-hander, committed several months
ago. The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey, 6-5,
230, a left-hander from Dallas Trinity Christian. He is considering Texas,
A&M and OU.
Purcey was 21-3 at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team won
back-to-back state TAPPS' championships. He also helped his team win a stat=
e
TAPPS' title in basketball last year. He had 123 strikeouts in 75 1/3 innin=
gs
last year.
Lavinski was 14-1 last year with an outstanding 0.70 ERA. His fast ball has
been clocked as high as 93 miles per hour and he is consistently in the 90
mph range. He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up=
.
He struck out 170 batters in 95 innings last year, while issuing about 25
walks and giving up about 40 hits.
He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas A&M, Baylor, Rice, Housto=
n
and Oklahoma State.
Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher, but he also wields a potent ba=
t,
bashing opposing pitchers for a .515 batting average last season.
He  also considered Alabama, Baylor and A&M.
Lavinski, Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September 23 weekend,
along with shortstop Michael Holloman, 6-0, 165, of Dallas Jesuit.
Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford. He visited Texas earlie=
r
and took his official trip to Stanford last weekend.

Horns Rise in Polls

The Longhorns are No. 11 in this week's Associated Press poll and No. 10 in
the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll. Oklahoma, this week's opponent, is No. 10 =
in
the AP poll and No. 12 in the coaches poll. UT is a 3-point favorite.

Basketball Stars Visit

Kala Bowers, 6-2, of Woodward, Okla., a top national recruit in girls
basketball, took her official visit to Texas last weekend.
She is considering Texas, Colorado, Illinois and Kansas State, and says Tex=
as
and Colorado are her big two.
Heather Schreiber, a versatile 6-2 forward from Windthorst and CoCo Reed, a
5-11 forward from Jersey Village, also came to Austin last weekend. Both
committed to the Longhorns earlier.
Three top juniors also were in Austin on unofficial visits. They are  5-9
point guard Nina Norman of Jersey Village, 5-10 shooting guard Lindsay
Harding of Cypress Fairbanks and 6-1 forward Nichelle Roberts of Spring
Westfield.
Schrieber and Bowers are both rated as top 25 national recruits, and Norman
will be one of the nation's top point guard recruits next season.
Reed and Roberts play on the same high school team and they also play on th=
e
same AAU team, along with Harding.

Longhorns Find Running Game Just in Time
To Maul OSU in Big 12 Opener; OU Next Foe

The Longhorns ran over, around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys and
their No. 1-rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a 42-7 victory befor=
e
a sellout crowd in Austin.
The Cowboys, while they hadn't played a good rushing team in their first
three games, had allowed only 91 net yards rushing all season and they real=
ly
do have a pretty salty front seven.
Led by sophomore Kenny Hayter's 122 yards, the Longhorns had 205 net yards
rushing. It was the first time Texas has has 100 net rushing yards in a gam=
e
since the 58-7 thumping of Texas Tech last season.
In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the=
y
couldn't reach the century mark in rushing, it's no coincidence that they w=
on
just twice.
But they utilized a new gap-blocking technique  to combat the Cowboys'
stunting defense, and it worked to near perfection because Hayter, who was =
a
little used third-team tailback, turned a lot of little holes into big ones
with his hard running.
While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story, it didn't
happen until the second half and UT had a shaky 10-7 lead at that point.
Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlier
developments =01)  a huge passing play, a great defensive stand after still
another special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out=
 a
potentially game-turning interception.
The huge passing play, of course, was Major Applewhite's 96-yard pass-and-r=
un
connection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep into
the second half
The Horns were holding a fragile 10-7 lead at the time, they were facing a
third-and-14 and they had already had so many problems with  their punting
team that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down.
After all, coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second half
is the most crucial period in a tight game, and the first five minutes had
been all Oklahoma State. The Longhorns hadn't even made a first down since
the intermission.
But they got a lot more than that. Williams got past the Cowboy cornerback
who was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety back
toward the middle.
When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball, the only question
was whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people in
college football who can catch the fleet freshman.
He did, catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of the
way. That 96-yard play gave Texas a 17-7 lead and it was all downhill after
that for the Longhorns.
But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t=
he
Cowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage and
put OSU in possession at the UT 38, and because an interception of a Chris
Simms' pass and a long runback inside the UT 10 was negated by a personal
foul penalty against the Cowboys.
The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSU's
only touchdown. The Cowboys were leading, 7-3, and the Longhorns, at that
point, hadn't generated enough offense to indicate they could fall farther
behind.
The disallowed interception was a possible 10-point swing because OSU might
have scored with a first-and-goal inside the UT 10. Instead, the Horns kept
the ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened the
scoring.

Here, briefly, is how the game went:

FIRST QUARTER
Neither team threatened early, but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon=
d
possession. They started in good field possession, but Simms threw an
interception that was run back inside the UT 10 before a personal foul
against OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU 29. Tex=
as
couldn't move and Stockton kicked a 45-yard field goal to put the Horns
ahead, 3-0, with 7:00 left. OSU TB Reggie White broke loose for 69 yards to
the UT 11 on the Cowboys' next possession, but the UT defense held and the
Cowboys missed a chip-shot field goal try. Applewhite came in at QB for
Texas. UT led, 3-0, at the end of the quarter, but the Longhorns had only o=
ne
first down =01) on the penalty that negated the long interception return =
=01) and
just 30 yards of total offense compared to 100 for OSU.

SECOND QUARTER
The UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt. With Applewhite still in at
QB, sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs, then seni=
or
TB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for 18 yards. But
Applewhite was sacked and his third-down pass to freshman WR B. J. Johnson
was dropped. That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt, the
snap was high, a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked.
Stockton covered it at the UT 30, and OSU's White scored in two plays,
galloping 21 yard to the 9, then bursting up the middle untouched for the
score to put OSU ahead, 7-3, with  9:59 left. The next UT drive also came u=
p
short, but, facing fourth and 1 at their own 40, the Horns went with a fake
punt. It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a two-yard loss. But t=
he
strong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba=
ck
for the offense. On his third try, Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en=
d
zone, driving 80 yards in seven plays. Mitchell got the TD on a 3-yard run,
but the big plays were Applewhite's passes of 15 yards to WR Montrell
Flowers, 14 yards on third-and-9 to Johnson and 36 yards to the 3 to
Williams. Stockton's kick gave Texas a 10-7 lead with 4:23 left. OSU got
close enough to try a field goal as time expired, but Ervis Hill blocked it=
.
UT outgained OSU, 140 to 80, in the period.

THIRD QUARTER
A combination of mishaps, including a sack and a half-the-distance penalty,
left the Longhorns facing a third and 14 from their own 4. Visions of anoth=
er
punting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere, but
Applewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between double
coverage just past midfield. He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it =
on
his fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a 96-yard
touchdown play. Stockton's kick put UT ahead, 17-7, with 9:14 left. Lindsay
and White misfired on a handoff two plays later and  UT LB De'Andre Lewis
recovered for Texas at the 13. Hayter powered to the 1 to set up a
first-and-goal. He tried to go over the top, but the Cowboys stopped him,
then the Horns were penalized back to the 6 for a false start. Hayter got
three yards to the 3 off right tackle, but Applewhite's pass on third down
was knocked down and Stockton's 20-yard field goal gave Texas a 20-7 lead
with 6:03 left. Applewhite hit redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis for 21 yard=
s
and another TD with 2:11 left. A two-point conversion try failed, leaving U=
P
on top, 26-7, heading into the final period.

FOURTH QUARTER
With Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes, the
Longhorns drove 58 yards to set up a 36-yard Stockton FG and moved 42 yards
for a touchdown, with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final 2
yards, Ivan Williams ran 21 yards for the final score with 13 seconds left.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of the
season against Oklahoma State, the defense did its usual fine job and the
special teams, with one notable exception, were outstanding.
""After reviewing the film, it's clear that it was the best performance we'v=
e
had offensively,"" he said. ""We scored 42 points and we had no turnovers. Th=
e
offensive line had its best performance.""
""We were pleased with not only the offensive line, but Roy Williams made so=
me
great blocks, too, and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs.""
He also said junior QB Major Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee
surgery, ""played like the Major of old. He made very, very few mistakes.""
The Major of old was very good. He was the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the
Year as a redshirt freshman in 1998 and the Co-Offensive Player of the Year
as a sophomore in 1999.
Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB, and Sim=
ms
started the OSU game, but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter.
Applewhite completed 15 of 28 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns.
Simms, who returned late in the game, completed 3 of 5 passes for 8 yards.
Brown said the defense ""continues to swarm and play really well. Casey
Hampton is amazing and D. D. Lewis had an outstanding day. Quentin Jammer a=
nd
Rod Babers played really well. We had another blocked kick. that's our 12th
in 30 games here. I thought it was Tyrone Jones, but it was Ervis Hill who
blocked the field goal. It's interesting that our two best kick blockers ar=
e
both from Texas City.""
The special teams played well, Brown said, except for having another punt
blocked, and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed.
""The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas,"" he said, ""b=
ut
we have to get it fixed. We can't keep getting punts blocked.""
He said the UT-OU game was such a big game 15 or 20 years ago ""that the
feeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation=
al
championship."" He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops ""are trying to get back t=
o
that.""
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said SS Lee Jackson suited out against Oklahoma State
and should be ready to play against Oklahoma. He said DT Shaun Rogers
(sprained ankle) is questionable for the OU game. ""We should know more abou=
t
Shaun Tuesday,"" he said. LB O. J. McClintock also missed the OSU game
(bruised knee), but he should be back this week.
BLOCKING, QUARTERBACK NOTES: The big change in the UT running game was
basically one new play - a counter with an off side guard pulling and the
linemen blocking down on the play side. The QB also handed off at least par=
t
of the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a little
bit of misdirection. . . Major Applewhite's knee has been one of he major (=
no
pun intended) reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much in
the early games. Applewhite still isn't 100%, but he's getting closer every
week. In fact, he looked pretty close to 100% Saturday. That's just in time
because the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two top
quarterbacks ready to go.

Baseball Recruiting Going Great

The UT  baseball coaches got a commitment last week from right-handed pitch=
er
Donald Lavinski, 6-4, 205, of Class AA state champion Weimar, giving them
pledges from two of the state's big three pitching recruits. They also got =
a
pledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen, 6-0, 175, of Forney.
Round Rock's Joey Guajardo, another right-hander, committed several months
ago. The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey, 6-5,
230, a left-hander from Dallas Trinity Christian. He is considering Texas,
A&M and OU.
Purcey was 21-3 at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team won
back-to-back state TAPPS' championships. He also helped his team win a stat=
e
TAPPS' title in basketball last year. He had 123 strikeouts in 75 1/3 innin=
gs
last year.
Lavinski was 14-1 last year with an outstanding 0.70 ERA. His fast ball has
been clocked as high as 93 miles per hour and he is consistently in the 90
mph range. He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up=
.
He struck out 170 batters in 95 innings last year, while issuing about 25
walks and giving up about 40 hits.
He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas A&M, Baylor, Rice, Housto=
n
and Oklahoma State.
Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher, but he also wields a potent ba=
t,
bashing opposing pitchers for a .515 batting average last season.
He  also considered Alabama, Baylor and A&M.
Lavinski, Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September 23 weekend,
along with shortstop Michael Holloman, 6-0, 165, of Dallas Jesuit.
Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford. He visited Texas earlie=
r
and took his official trip to Stanford last weekend.

Horns Rise in Polls

The Longhorns are No. 11 in this week's Associated Press poll and No. 10 in
the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll. Oklahoma, this week's opponent, is No. 10 =
in
the AP poll and No. 12 in the coaches poll. UT is a 3-point favorite.

Basketball Stars Visit

Kala Bowers, 6-2, of Woodward, Okla., a top national recruit in girls
basketball, took her official visit to Texas last weekend.
She is considering Texas, Colorado, Illinois and Kansas State, and says Tex=
as
and Colorado are her big two.
Heather Schreiber, a versatile 6-2 forward from Windthorst and CoCo Reed, a
5-11 forward from Jersey Village, also came to Austin last weekend. Both
committed to the Longhorns earlier.
Three top juniors also were in Austin on unofficial visits. They are  5-9
point guard Nina Norman of Jersey Village, 5-10 shooting guard Lindsay
Harding of Cypress Fairbanks and 6-1 forward Nichelle Roberts of Spring
Westfield.
Schrieber and Bowers are both rated as top 25 national recruits, and Norman
will be one of the nation's top point guard recruits next season.
Reed and Roberts play on the same high school team and they also play on th=
e
same AAU team, along with Harding.

Subject: American Diabetes Association

Friends and Colleagues,

I want to apologize in advance for the impersonal nature of this request; 
but, I believe that the potential results may justify the means.  I am 
requesting that each of you strongly consider making a contribution to the 
American Diabetes Association.  My sister, Valerie, who is a school teacher 
at the Rice School has organized a ""School Walk"" to benefit the ADA.  
Although I am always reluctant to solicit contributions from my friends and 
co-workers, I feel emotionally compelled to do so this time.  In addition to 
my sister's involvement in this fund raiser, my brother Steven was diagnosed 
several years ago with Adult On-Set Juvenile Diabetes and I have seen first 
hand what a terrible disease this can be to manage.  There is good news, as 
many of you know.  The research in this area has made great strides in recent 
years and I am encouraged that someday soon there will be a cure.

In this regard, I would truly appreciate any contribution that each of you 
might be able to make.  Something as small as $5.00 would be great. (although 
if your pockets are full and you want to give more that is ok too)  I would 
be forever grateful if, through the donations that I am able to collect, I am 
able to make a difference.  Please feel free to send your checks via 
inter-office mail or stop by if you wish.  Thank you for your consideration.

With much appreciation,

Stuart

Hi Monette,

Regarding the press conference on the Houston Fire Chief selection
committee, I have only two possible dates that will work with Jeff
Skilling's calendar. February 1 is the preferred date, anytime after
1:30pm. Alternatively, February 2, anytime between 1:30pm and 3:30pm.

Let's touch base tomorrow and try to pencil in a date for the press
conference. Also, I don't have contact information for you...

Thanks,

Lisa

Subject: Westgate Proforma-Phillip Allen.xls


Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin
that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project
should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.
This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as
Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for
this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we
have uncovered to date in the Austin market.
The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As
it is in the ""Smart Growth Corridor"" area designated by the City of Austin
for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete
in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe
water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot
improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North
Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street
widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street
widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond
requirement, I used this data to be cautious.
 The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not
expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite
successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the
adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.
As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods
is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may
only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far
preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer
preferences.
The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and
an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site
plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into
an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.
This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the
profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss
having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity
with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a
1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a
rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then
be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an
exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San
Antonio if you do not know anyone.
I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,
by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.
Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to
schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as
your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any
time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either
512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is
512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you
on this project that is sure to be a major winner.
I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual
events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg
downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.
One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to
start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough
to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took
another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take
my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra
in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this
past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize
the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as
if she will be ok in the long run.
